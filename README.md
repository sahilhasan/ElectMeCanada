# Methodology
Used preparsed data (parsed using a java project. See other projects on my github) from 37778 data points of people who have run for Canadian Parliament since 1867 and gauges the highest voter percentage per profession. This is then displayed in a searchable list. Sorting was done using a modified Heapsort that sorts based on any variable given. Website then displays the year in, the party with, and the riding in which they ran.
